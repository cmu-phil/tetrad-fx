# tetrad-fx

We're doing some doodlings here to try to make a lightweight [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) UI using JavaFX. The idea is to use the Tetrad library (and continue to refine and develop it without giving up the Swing app) but present that material in a perhaps different interface with a new look and feel, taking advantage of what's available in JavaFX (which is quite a lot and is strongly supported by the community).

Summary of what we have so far:
* A data viewer and a graph viewer.
* A sketch of one possible interface idea. Not committed to this by any stretch of the imagination, nor is it even complete, just playing around with what FX and Java's object orientation can do. Some underlying Tetrad library code is being adjusted to suit. This is very early. But a lot of the menu items do something at least, even if they're not all implemented. But honestly, we may do it a different way entirely, who knows?
* We had the idea of including some causal search "games" for people to play to familiarize themselves with the theory and demystify what's going on. We think this would be a contribution to the community. In the interface, we describe some such games we'd like to implement and include. If these go well, we may add more.
