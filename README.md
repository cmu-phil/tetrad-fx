# tetrad-fx

We're doing some doodlings here to try to make an alternative, lightweight [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) UI using JavaFX. The idea is to use the Tetrad library (and continue to refine and develop it without giving up the Swing app) but present that material in a perhaps different interface with a new look and feel, taking advantage of what's available in JavaFX (which is quite a lot and is strongly supported by the community).

One idea we had, which we're currently pursuing, is to shift the focus of Tetrad away from simulation studies and more toward analysis of particular datasets. We find that users are often perplexed by the full-blown modular interface of the Swing app and are often not particularly interested in doing simulation or don't see the point of it. But Tetrad is a very general tool; it's possible to orient it toward the analysis of particular datasets that the user loads in, with simulation as just one possible tool among many for understanding how a particular dataset works from a causal point of view. It's mostly straightforward to make an interface like this in JavaFX, especially since most of the "guts" of such a project are already implemented in the Tetrad library. We need to implement the relevant components in JavaFX and organize them in a different way. So we're trying that.
