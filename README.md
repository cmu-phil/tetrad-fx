# tetrad-fx

We're doing some doodlings here to try to make a Tetrad UI using JavaFX, which should make for a better and more flexible interface than Swing. So far we have a data display (which FX basically provides, just needed a little coaxing) and a graph display. The data display is uneditable and may remain so as editing datasets in Tetrad has never really been done. (Data transformations are done but not editing; we'll add the data transformations.) The graph display however does need to be editable, and more functionality (coloring and such and more layouts), so that will come.

We started with these two components since they are the most complicated components in the Tetrad interface. As time permits we will add more. FX allows for flexible styling, so eventually we should even be able to add some of that to make it a nice interface.

We are not committed to making an FX interface, just fooling around right now, but if you have comments one way or the other feel free to leave them in the Issues list.

##### Holy crap you guys are cloning me already! Awesome! But I _just made this_ :-D It's very preliminary. But please, if you have ideas for how thie project should proceed, please let me know! Or feel free to steal anything!
