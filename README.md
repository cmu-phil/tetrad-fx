# tetrad-fx

We're doing some doodlings here to try to make an alternative, lightweight [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) UI using JavaFX. The idea is to use the Tetrad library (and continue to refine and develop it without giving up the Swing app) but present that material in a perhaps different interface with a new look and feel, taking advantage of what's available in JavaFX (which is quite a lot and is strongly supported by the community).

One idea we had, which we're currently pursuing, is to shift the focus of Tetrad away from simulation studies and more toward analysis of particular datasets.

This project is a bit of a mess at the moment but will hopefully clear up in a few days. 2023-9-16.
