# tetrad-fx

We're doing some doodlings here to try to make a lightweight [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) UI using JavaFX, which should make for a better and more flexible interface than Swing. We have a data display now and a graph display and are using ChatGPT to learn how to do new stuff in JavaFX. For instance we just added pinch zooming for graphs, something tht in Swing was difficult. So easy here!

I was writing details for this, but it's starting to take some primordial shape so if you want to try it go for it. Let us know what you think. There will probably be daily updates for a while.
