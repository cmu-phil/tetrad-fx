# tetrad-fx

We're doing some doodlings here to try to make a lightweight [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) UI using JavaFX. The idea is to use the Tetrad library (and continue to refine and develop it without giving up the Swing app) but present that material in a perhaps different interface with a new look and feel.
