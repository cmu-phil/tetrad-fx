# tetrad-fx

We're doing some doodling here to try to make an alternative, 
lightweight [Tetrad](https://github.com/cmu-phil/tetrad) UI using JavaFX. 
The idea is to use the Tetrad library (and continue to refine and 
develop that without giving up the Swing app) but present that material 
in a different interface with a new look and feel, taking advantage 
of what's available in JavaFX.

A first draft is done as promised, September 30, 2023, Comments are welcome.
A lot of functionality is still missing, but I do not want to continue
to work on the project unless there's a concensus that I should continue.
So far it's been a fairly minimal amount of work.

An idea we have been pursuing is to shift the focus of
Tetrad away from simulation studies and more toward analysis of particular 
datasets. What we're doing at the moment is making an app that allows 
you to load a dataset, transform the data in various ways, search on
data yielding a graph and transforming that graph in various ways.

We are keeping a running overview of the work here:
