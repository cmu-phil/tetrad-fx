This directory contains some methods and files that need 
to go into the next version of Tetrad. Originally we were 
just going to use snapshot versions for this and keep up, 
but IntelliJ has problems with snapshot versions here if 
you're not the guy who posted them. So we're sticking with 
version 7.5.0 of Tetrad and making notes off to the side here.

When the next version of Tetrad comes out, we'll need to
merge these changes into the new version. and update
the POM file for this project.
