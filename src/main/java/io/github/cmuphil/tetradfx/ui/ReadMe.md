This package contains the classes that make up the TetradFX UI.

Goals of first draft:

* Load datsets and allow searches to be done on them with knowledge.
* Allow the user to set parmaeters for each search.
* Allow the suer to switch back and forth between analyses for loaded datasets.
* Allow notes to be taken on each component with notes on parameters settings as well.
* Make stock simulations with true graphs.
* Allow grpah layouts to be done.
* Allow transformations of data and graphs.
* Allow some tutorial games to be played.

TODO FOR THE FIRST DRAFT BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER (prioritized):

1. Save notes and parameter field texts to the file system and reload on loading a session.
1. Add more standard controls to the data loader.
1. Make a parameter editor for search.
1. Make a Knowledge editor, persist knowledge.
  
POSTPONE FOR IF WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE THIS PROJECT:

1. Add stuff to the Help menu.
1. Fix Data/Variables annotator. 
    1. Add a data field to the Variables tab.
    1. Download the trial of Analytica on a Windows laptop and see how they annotate datasets and variables.
    1. Figure out how to persist valence information.
1. Markov checker
1. Add graph comparisons to the Insignts menu.
1. Graph Viewer
    1. Make the graph viewer selectable.
    1. Rubberband selection.
1. Make PC and d-separation games.
    1. Save and load games to the directory. (As graphs, I guess.)
    1. Maybe think if game should go somewhere else.
1. Add model estimation for lieear and multinomial.
1. Keep track of parents and children for each component in the session.
1. Adding in annotations to list all Tetrad algorithms and sort them by type, and display information about each algorithm.
